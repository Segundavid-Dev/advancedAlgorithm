*Case Study: Text Analysis*

In 1949, Dr. Rudolf Flesch published The Art of Readable Writing, in which he
proposed a measure of text readability known as the Flesch Index. This index is
based on the average number of syllables per word and the average number of
words per sentence in a piece of text. Index scores usually range from 0 to 100,
and indicate readable prose for the following grade levels:

FLESCH INDEX ||  GRADE LEVEL OF READABILITY
0–30     ||      College
50–60    ||      High School
90–100   ||      Fourth Grade

*Request* 
Write a program that computes the Flesch Index and grade level for text stored
in a text file.

*Flesch’s formula to calculate the index F is the following*
F = 206.835 – 1.015 x (words / sentences) – 84.6 x (syllables / words)
